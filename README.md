#  Temperature Forecasting

## Overview
This project provides implementations for predicting temperature using Neural Networks:
- **FNN (Feedforward Neural Network)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network)**

## Instructions
1. **Download and unzip the `data.zip` file.**  
   This contains the required dataset.

2. **Run the code files:**
   - `FNN Codes`: Contains the FNN-based forecasting code.
   - `LSTM Codes`: Contains the LSTM-based forecasting code.

## Notes
- Make sure the unzipped dataset is placed in the same directory as the code files, or update the file paths accordingly.
- Both scripts include:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Model definition, training, and evaluation
  - Visualization of the predicted vs. true temperatures
